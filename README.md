# OpenFreeMap Styles
This contains the forks of the following styles:

**Bright** - forked from https://github.com/openmaptiles/osm-bright-gl-style

**Positron** - forked from https://github.com/openmaptiles/positron-gl-style

**Dark** - forked from https://github.com/openmaptiles/dark-matter-gl-style

**Liberty** - forked from https://github.com/maputnik/osm-liberty



All the OpenMapTiles styles (**Bright**, **Positron**, **Dark**) are abandoned by their upstream project. If you feel like maintaining the forks, please reach out!

**Liberty** is still fresh and alive, we are only planning to add automatic / read-only changes to that one.
